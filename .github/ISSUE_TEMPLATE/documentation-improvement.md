### Problem
Tell us about the confusion introduced in the documentation:
* **Ambiguous**
"[...] made me think that [...] when really it should be [...]"
"I found [...] to be unclear because [...]"
* **Missing**
"There is no example showing how to do [...]"
* **Wrong**
"The Installation Guide says to run `[...]` when it should be `[...]`"
* **Outdated**
"The function `foo` used in the code snippet has been renamed to `bar`"

If you are referencing an existing piece of documentation or example please provide a link.

### Suggested Improvement
If you have an idea to improve the documentation please suggest it here
* "This line should be be changed to say [...]"
* "Include a paragraph explaining [...]"
* "Add a figure showing [...]"
