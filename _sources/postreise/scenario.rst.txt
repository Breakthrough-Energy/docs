Scenario used
-------------
You will find below a short description of the scenarios that will be used across this
tutorial:

- Scenario 403 was designed to represent the Eastern interconnect in the year 2020.
- Scenario 3287 was designed to represent the entire U.S. in the year 2030, where there
  is a large increase in transmission capacity (but no increase across interconnection
  seams) and carbon-free energy represents approximately 70% of total generation over
  the course of the year.
- Scenario 2497 was designed to represent the Western interconnect in the year 2030,
  where 90% of the total energy could come from carbon-free sources, but the
  transmission network has not been upgraded to accommodate these new clean generation
  sources. Of this 90% potential, 10% could come from nuclear.
- Scenario 1171 was designed to represent the Western interconnect in the year 2030,
  with all states meeting their clean energy goals (with 'collaboration' via imports
  and exports across state lines) and there are 4 GW of energy storage capacity.
- Scenario 3101 was designed to represent the Western interconnect in the year 2030,
  where 90% of the total energy does come from carbon-free sources, enabled by upgrades
  in the transmission network to accommodate these new clean generation sources. Of
  this 90% potential, 10% comes from nuclear.
