Mentored Project Ideas
======================
Breakthrough Energy Sciences (BES) is actively developing tools to carry out realistic power flow study in the U.S. electric grid and thus support Breakthrough Energy's mission of helping the world to get to net-zero greenhouse gases emission.

If you are new to BES, visit our `website <https://science.breakthroughenergy.org>`_ to
learn more about our organization.

There is no shortage of work. If you have some free time and want to contribute to an open source project aiming at decarbonizing the grid, please reach out.


Getting in Touch
----------------
We are active on Slack and this is the best way to reach us. Join us by filling out
this `form <http://science.breakthroughenergy.org/#get-updates>`_, introduce yourself,
discuss your potential project in the #ideas channel, and let us know if you have any
questions. If you need to reach us via email please use sciences@breakthroughenergy.org.

Please review our :doc:`code_of_conduct` before joining the community.


Project Ideas
---------
For new contributors, we have compiled some project ideas we would love to work on with
you. Ideas for each repository can be found as issues with the ``good first issue``
label. Within each issue, we provide prerequisites along with a level of difficulty that
should assist you in your decision. If you canâ€™t find your ideal project but you have
something else in mind that would benefit our open source project, let's discuss it in the
#ideas channel on Slack.

Also keep in mind when planning out your work that for each project we expect you to
follow our :doc:`../dev/contribution_guide`.
