# Working with git
We loosely follow this branching model:
https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

The main take on this is:
* Branch off from _develop_ to create a feature branch. 
  - ``` git checkout develop ```
  - ``` git checkout username/featurename ```
* When work done rebase feature branch on _develop_.
  - ``` git pull --rebase origin develop ```
* Create a pull request to merge back into _develop_ (See [Pull Request Etiquette](https://github.com/Breakthrough-Energy/REISE/wiki/Pull-Request-Etiquette)).
* The pull request requires a code review by at least one other person.
* Main reviewer decides on type of merge to be performed.
  * fast-forward(```git merge```) or no-fast-forward ```git merge --no-ff```.
* Clean up git history with ```git rebase -i HEAD~n```.
* Perform designated merge.

## Semantic Commit Messages

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

# Pull Request Etiquette

# Writing Testable Code
Please follow these principles when writing code:
https://github.com/intvenlab/REISE/wiki/Writing-testable-code
## Training 
[Intro to Python testing](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-testing/)
# Writing Tests
Add tests when contributing new code. Follow this guideline:
https://github.com/intvenlab/REISE/wiki/Testing-Guidelines-for-Python-and-Matlab
# Cleaning Code (before code goes back into _develop_)
* Remove content that is not necessary.
* Remove paths to external (outside of the package) folders.
* Use relative paths within a package.
* Rename variables, functions, classesâ€¦ if necessary.
* Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format code. This covers [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as well as other rules to produce deterministic output.
  * Run via installation in virtual env: `pip install black` and `black .`
  * OR - install externally and have your editor do it automatically.
* Black doesn't sort imports - this can be done with isort:
  * pip install isort
  * isort test.py
* Notebooks go into demo folder only.
# Document Code (before code goes back into develop)
* Description of the method goes into the README.md.
* Describe the operations of functions or classes with docstrings.
  * For docstring use reSt in order to use Sphinx. Here is a [CheatSheet](http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#explicit-links).

```
:param arg1: description
:param arg2: description
:type arg1: type description
:type arg1: type description
:return: return description
:rtype: the return type description
:raises keyError: raises an exception
```
* Document section within the code
