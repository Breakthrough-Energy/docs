How it Works
============

We built a simulation framework in order to perform power flow study in the U.S. electrical grid. The framework and the available features are presented in the README of the :doc:`powersimdata_package` package. There are a few options for using the framework, each with different advantages. We provide more detailed information in the :doc:`installation guide <user/installation_guide>`.

Note that in any case, you should have a `Gurobi <https://www.gurobi.com>`_ license - this is the mathematical solver that our engine use to find power flow solutions to the DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) problems. Note: other solvers will be supported in the future.
