Welcome to Breakthrough Energy Sciences software documentation.
We are developing various software packages to study how to reduce carbon emissions in the energy field.
Currently the focus is on clean energy integration in the electrical grid. We are developing three packages.
:doc:`prereise_package` is used to gather and build input data for clean energy integration studies.
:doc:`powersimdata_package` is a framework that facilitates the integration studies.
:doc:`postreise_package` is dedicated to the analysis and plotting of the results of the studies.

To get started, here you can find the :doc:`user/installation_guide`.
If you are here to contribute to the project, here are the :doc:`dev/contribution_guidelines` .
Thank you for your contribution.
